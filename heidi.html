  <p>Navigating the web has turned into a treacherous exercise. Between sidebars, popups, scroll overs, and pre-checked boxes, you have to avoid the content you donâ€™t want to unearth the content you do want. As these practices in distraction and diversion become the norm, marketers are pressured to follow suit.</p>
  <p>Together we will look at the difference between influencing genuine user behavior and tricking people through the use of CSS patterns and interactions. Learn how you can add motion into your digital properties in a way that improves usability while staying true to your brand's goals.</p>
