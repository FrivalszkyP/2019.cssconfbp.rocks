When you run into a browser bug, what can you do? I'll give how-to steps ranging from a quick vote on a bug through submitting a test case, all with real-life stories on how effective some extra effort can be. At the end of the talk listeners will have the resources to submit bug reports with W3C cross-browser tests that can be incorporated in every browser's test systems. This gives the best chances for fixing the problem, and ensures browsers will regression test the fix for eternity.
