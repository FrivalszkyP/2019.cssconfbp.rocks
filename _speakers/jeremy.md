"Of all the parts of Houdini, paint worklets are arguably the coolest. Imagine if you started with the Canvas API, but then made it embeddable in—and parameterized by—CSS. This is the quirky sort of marriage that can only lead to best kind of fun and experimentation the internet is known for.

Come to this session and you'll not only understand how paint worklets, well, work, but also what's possible when you fuse the programatic generation of art with your designs. By the end of this talk, you'll not only discover what's fun about paint worklets, but also what's practical."
