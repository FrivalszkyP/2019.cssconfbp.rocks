Using SVG in the websites or the products we create is a great way to provide a delightful experience to our users.

SVG elements may appear cryptic, though they can be styled like any other DOM elements. Styled, transformed, transitioned, animated even!

This talk is not about telling you what you can build. You already know that. This talk is about giving you a glimpse of what you could build.

Prepare to embark on a short trip. Destination, SVG Animations in your daily workflow.
