bio: Mike is an independent web developer from Australia who has worked on some of Australia’s largest websites as well as some of the smallest community sites. He loves learning new things and finding techniques that challenge what we think is best practice. And when he’s not exploring the digital landscape, he likes to explore the world. Currently trying to find a way to do both those things at the same time.

Are all these conventions dead? If so, what has replaced them? Or, are some lessons from the past still relevant?
