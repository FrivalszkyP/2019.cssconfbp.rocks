    <h3>
      The Quick Version
    </h3>

    <p>
      CSSConf Budapest is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
      everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
      body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
      in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
      including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants
      violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
      *without a refund* at the discretion of the conference organizers.
    </p>

    <h3>
      The Less Quick Version
    </h3>

    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation,
      disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
      deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography
      or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
      contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should
      not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers)
      should not use sexualized  clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any
      action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
      concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can
      be identified by a yellow conference shirt with the word 'STAFF' on it.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
      law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
      feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and
      conference-related social events.
