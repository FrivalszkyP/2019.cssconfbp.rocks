    <h2>
      The Quick Version
    </h2>

    <p>
      CSSConf Budapest is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
      everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
      body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
      in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
      including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants
      violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
      <strong>without a refund</strong> at the discretion of the conference organizers.
    </p>

    <h2>
      The Less Quick Version
    </h2>

      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should
        not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers)
        should not use sexualized  clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any
        action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      </p>

    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
      concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can
      be identified by a conference shirt with the word 'STAFF' on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case you can’t find a staff member, Dóri is always there for you:

      <a href="tel:+36306871080"><span>+36 30 6871080</span></a>
    </p>

      <p>
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
        law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
        feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
      </p>

    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and
      conference-related social events.
