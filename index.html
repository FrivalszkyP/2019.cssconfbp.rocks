    <p><small>Since the prototype, CSSConf US, was started by Nicole Sullivan in 2013, the CSSConf family has expanded around the globe. CSSConf US in New York and CSSConf EU in Berlin are going into their third year. CSSConf Australia in Melbourne, CSSConf Asia in Singapore, and CSSConf Oakland debuted in 2014. In 2016, two new members joined the family of events: CSSConf Nordic, and yours truly, CSSConf Budapest. All CSSConf event organizer teams share the vision of an international, diverse and creative CSS community, for which the CSSConf series offers a platform to meet, hack, share knowledge and build friendships.</small></p>
